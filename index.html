        <p>Hello, I am Simon Roy A Junior at the University of Rhode Island. I am from Portsmouth Rhode Island and this is currently my first time ever coding. So far I have found it very difficult o write the correct and fine tuned code to get this website up and working. However, I am definitely making
            process slowly but surely. I hope that at the end of this course I will be a master at the skill of coding and an assignment such as this will come with ease.
